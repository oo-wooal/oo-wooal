- ⚡ Fun fact: The name "Istio" is derived from the Greek word "ίστιο," which means "sail" or "sailor." This name is quite fitting for Istio since it acts as a service mesh that helps navigate and steer network traffic within complex distributed systems. Just like a sailor uses a sail to control the direction of a ship, Istio provides a way to manage traffic flow and enforce policies between services in a cloud-native environment.
